## Are you or your loved ones a *bride-to-be* or *groom-to-be*? 
> Feel free to use this template to build your wedding website!

To reuse this, follow the steps:

```js
// Set the date we're counting down to
var countDownDate = new Date("Jan 24, 2022 00:00:00").getTime();
```

- *If you wish to change the track which plays on click, edit the `src` in [index.html](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Wedding-Invitation/blob/760c4aa437115fc365f5cb86a4b428b0e292b5ba/index.html#L69)*

```

> <sup>Despite so many new Bollywood and English song options, I prefered to use two-decade-old song, **[Din Shagna Da](https://youtu.be/X0MDALpV29s)**! Ever attended a North Indian Wedding? As soon as the DJ plays [Din Shagna Da](https://youtu.be/Mj4eK5YViCs) song, it means that the much-awaited moment is here and the bride is all set to put her first foot forward to the wedding venue under a breathtaking phoolon ki chaadar. Let's keep the sky-high status of this song untouched! When the website is backed up with a soul-stirring track, the feeling becomes absolutely surreal. **Choose a heart-touching track!** :musical_note: :heart: </sup>
